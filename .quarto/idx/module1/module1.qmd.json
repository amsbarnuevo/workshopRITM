AMR hampers the control of infectious diseases because patients remain infectious for a longer time increasing the risk of spreading resistant microorganisms to others. AMR increases the cost of health care as more expensive therapies must be used when infections become resistant to first-line medicines. Infections due to resistant microorganisms increases economic burden to families and societies as it often results in longer duration of illness and treatment.\n\nThe DOH-ARSP is a sentinel laboratory-based antimicrobial resistance surveillance on aerobic bacteria from clinical specimens. Currently participating in the program are 24 sentinel sites, and 2 gonococcal surveillance sites, representing 16 out of the 17 regions of the country. The surveillance collects data on culture and antimicrobial susceptibility from its 24 sentinel sites and 2 gonococcal surveillance sites. Case finding is based on priority specimens sent routinely to sentinel sites laboratories for clinical purposes\n\nAll sentinel sites implement standard methods for culture and susceptibility testing based on the WHO Manual for the Laboratory Identification and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing of Bacterial Pathogens of Public Health Importance in the Developing World 3 and the updated Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) references for antibiotic susceptibility testing and quality control. Panel of antibiotics for testing are based on the latest CLSI recommendations. In the analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, an isolate is considered resistant to an antimicrobial agent when tested and interpreted as resistant (R) in accordance with the clinical breakpoint criteria based on the most recent Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) references for antibiotic susceptibility testing ^\\[2\\]^ The culture and antimicrobial susceptibility test results are encoded using a database software called WHONET. WHONET is Windows-based database software developed by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance based at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston for the management and analysis of microbiology laboratory data with a special focus on the analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility test results. Using a standard format, routine culture and antimicrobial susceptibility test results are sent through automatic data transfer by the sentinel sites to the coordinating laboratory of the program – the Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Reference Laboratory (ARSRL) at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine.\n\nThe ARSRL’s Data Management Unit manages the cleaning, analysis, storage and security of the program’s surveillance data. Sentinel sites likewise send isolates with unusual antimicrobial susceptibility patterns to ARSRL for phenotypic and genotypic confirmatory testing. At the reference laboratory, all isolates with unusual susceptibility patterns received for confirmatory testing are re-identified using both automated (Vitek) and conventional methods. Both minimum inhibitor concentration (MIC) - via automated method (Vitek) and gradient E-test, and disk diffusion are employed in antimicrobial susceptibility testing. As indicated, additional testing is done for specific antibiotics which are not included in AST card in use in the reference laboratory and for susceptibility testing for specific bacteria such as *N. gonorrhea* which requires manual AST methods. Serotyping for *S. pneumoniae*, *H. influenzae*, *Salmonellae*, *Shigellae* and *Vibrio cholera*e were done for 2022. Further, for 2022, select isolates with resistance phenotype which have not been previously reported or have been only rarely reported to date underwent whole genome sequencing (WGS) at the Antimicrobial Surveillance Reference Laboratory (ARSRL). The genomic characterization of these isolates is meant to allow for the understanding of resistance mechanisms of these isolates as well as their potential for spread in order to inform control and prevention measures. Beginning January 2018, sentinel sites transmit culture and susceptibility data daily to the reference laboratory (ARSRL) through ARSP ftp server using WinSCP. The automated data transfer facilitates prompt identification by the ARSRL of resistant isolates of public health importance as well the identification of clustering of cases and potential outbreaks among sentinel sites.                  \n\n SaTScan is a free cluster-detection software application embedded in WHONET which is used by epidemiologists globally to describe spatial clusters of infectious and chronic disease, as well as disease vectors and risk factors. The software can identify whether the infection is randomly distributed over space, overtime or over space and time. Moreover, it allows the evaluation of the statistical significance of disease cluster alarms. The study of Natale et al. (2017), in a health-care facility in Italy showed that WHONET-saTScan was able to detect higher number of potential outbreaks as compared with the traditional epidemiological approach of investigation.^\\[3\\]^ Moreover, Huang et al. (2010) stated that  WHONET-SaTScan rapidly detected the two previously known gram negative pathogen clusters and identified six Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and four Vancomycin Resistant Enterococci (VRE) clusters that were previously not recorded in the hospital facility.^\\[4\\]^\n\nThis software coupled with the use of whole genome sequencing (WGS) are the emerging tools for outbreak investigation.  WGS refers to the construction of the complete nucleotide sequence of a bacterium. This technique enables the analysis of the entire DNA sequence of the genome including the non-coding regions of DNA. Moreover, it has the capacity to identify functionally important sequence variants that affects gene expression. The advantages and functionality of WGS delivers ultimate high resolution genotypic method which makes it a powerful approach for outbreak investigation together with epidemiological approach.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# ![](images/clipboard-1825711664.png){width=\"37\"}**OUTLOOK**\n\nUnit 1 describes the rationale and the steps on the conduct of outbreak investigation of ARSRL featuring the SaTScan software of WHONET and Whole Genome Sequencing.
