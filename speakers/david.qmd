-   David is the director of the Centre for Genomic Pathogen Surveillance (CGPS), which is at the forefront of bringing data modelling, software development, epidemiology, bioinformatics and machine learning, genomic technology, training and capacity building to deliver actionable public health information.

-   With the collective effort of his team, the Centre successfully developed digital epidemiology tools: Epicollect5, Pathogenwatch and Microreact which aids in surveillance of microbial pathogens through a combination of web application, software engineering and the use of genome sequencing.

-   Works with major public health agencies such as the US CDC, the European CDC, Public Health England, Wales, Scotland and the WHO. The Centre also hosts an NIHR-funded Global Health Research Unit on Genomic Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance, working with partners leading National AMR strategies in The Philippines, Colombia, Nigeria and India to implement genomic surveillance and linking to routine phenotypic and epidemiological data for priority pathogens.
